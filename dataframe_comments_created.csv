I will get heavily downvoted for this, but Dublin gets less than most countries as huge amounts of subsidies have to go elsewhere in the country.

I don't think every route should be 24/7, I don't think that's realistic right now, but you should be able to reach major centres 24/7.

I think if you are prepared to do a bit of research and adjust your plans then you can have an okay experience, but really we shouldn't be at a point where that has to happen. The government and transport companies look at passenger numbers and think it is as high as can be be, rather than realising that there's a ton of people out there who would use it if they didn't have to wait two hours between services. The same problem is the reason they don't replace connections through the capital with direct services: sure people don't go from Cork to Sligo now, so why bother? It's this attitude that needs to change at all levels of power, otherwise we will be three decades down the road and Dublin will still dominate the country with all the current issues that it brings. Getting any form of public transport between cities is always going to be cheaper than the car, but the car drops you at your house not in a windswept station with no facilities and relying on a connecting service to finish your journey.

Irish Rail is very cheap compared to the UK, the problem is simply one of capacity and frequency. Things like staff, engine and driver numbers will always impose an upper ceiling on things but Irish Rail doesn't seem prepared to ramp up train numbers to bring in any latent demand. They think that the 9pm train being quiet is a reason not to put on an 11pm one, rather than realising that people are simply driving because there's no other option.

The intercity coaches are a good fallback if you need to get somewhere later at night, but my experience of these is solely travelling between Dublin and another city. You might get lucky if you happen to be on the end of a spur, so Limerick to Ennis or Cork to Tralee, or somewhere on the way, like Kildare village, but outside of that you are screwed. That said, I find the intercities are reliable and cheap, but as somebody else said, interacting with the driver on a basic question can drastically change your opinion. I don't know if it's because some services are government-run or because there is a driver shortage and they can get away with it, but the way some speak to passengers who are being polite and asking sensible questions is shocking. I totally understand that there are plenty of arsehole passengers too, but I actually see less of those compared to drivers kicking off.

In the cities the bus problem for me is that they simply don't run late enough, and then you are in the hands of taxi drivers who are openly turning meters off because they are never inspected. Same problem with the Luas and the Dart, which only cover a minority of the city anyway. Again I find the fares cheap, it's like 1.35 or something in Limerick, but I can imagine having to connect between services is no craic. Also I find the bus drivers seem to be much less unhinged than the coach drivers, although I figured they'd have much more reason to hate every passenger they see.

For my pipe dream, I'd have every city north and south connected by a direct service, as well as every university, port and airport. I'd have most of the arterial carriageways and all circular routes in Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Derry and Galway have a tramline in the bus lane. Dublin has already re-designed the bus network based on this system. Any major European city, and most of the smaller ones, have this system. Lisbon had a massive tram network right across the oldest parts of town where routes wind around tiny hillside streets, the particular trams are smaller in those parts but even Porto, Prague, Cologne, Milan and Stockholm all have this. I've never used the rental bikes and scooters as I have my own and live in a small city, but I see plenty of young people and loads of tourists using them, probably a good alternative to ramming a bike into a one-bedroom apartment. I'd also personally collect and bury every single Leap card at the bottom of the sea and replace it with a contactless system that is seamless between services, meaning you get off a bus and onto a bike within 90 minutes and it is a single charge. 

We have to be serious about climate change but even if you don't give a shit about that, these are all things that exist in plenty of other places that we like to group ourselves into, and plenty of others we don't. For a small country with no major environmental challenges of freak weather events to contend with, as well as a massive budget surplus to spend, we should have a significant headstart on most other places, but we're crippled by parochialism, short-termism and a lack of strategic thinking. There's finally work being done on a rail link between Limerick and Foynes, and it only seemed to get over the line because they don't want rich Americans stuck in traffic for the Ryder Cup. The operator at Foynes and the EU was pleading with the government to re-open the line, and when they finally decided to, they forgot to survey the part of the line that goes to the cement factory. We're talking 2 or 3km of track that could take major freight traffic off the road, but as usual everyone thought it was somebody else's problem.",0.06250257335257337,1

The thing with public transport is that it's not designed, the routes, for tourism. It likes the large urban centres, patchily sure, but if you want to get to say, the Cliff of Moher it doesn't do that easily.

Public transport requires time. Time that a lot of people on short vacations can't afford. Hell, we also tell them not to try drive the entire country in 4 days too because there's a balance, as in all things. 

Also, accessibility. Coach buses that traverse the country every day have either no, or extremely limited accessibility, so if you've a mobility issue, or a bladder issue tbh, coach transport can be really hit or miss. The trains don't go everywhere, can be overcrowded and at times, fucking expensive for what you're getting and while the trains themselves have way better accessibility, getting on and off them, and out of the stations even can prove very challenging for wheelchair users or people with ambulatory restrictions. 

Taxis, again, accessible taxis are few and far between. And if you have to go far in one, that's the cost of a car rent far the day even. 

Public transport is a great way to move a lot of people, but they also aren't the best way for everyone.

119,"I would highly advise against using public transport in Ireland for a number of reasons.


**1. Expensive**
In comparison to other EU countries, it's ridiculously expensive. The train costs €22.50 to get from Dublin to Westport (probably more now) - in comparison, in France, you can travel a similar distance near Montpellier for €1. Buses here are also crazy expensive compared to the rest of Europe. It costs more to travel from Shannon Airport to Galway than it does to take a flight from Spain to Ireland.


**2. Lack of Quality**
I took a bus two weeks ago, there was one empty row at the back, when I got there, the entire seat was broken and pulled away from the back. You'll find the depths in the windows covered in years of dirt, not to mention the smell of shite. The same goes for trains. You'll have a sore arse after an hour journey.

**3. No Country for Students**
The NTA (The Irish body for national transport) recently banned all student cards for travelling, allowing only a special paid card which cannot be availed of by any student outside of Ireland (and many within Ireland, because lots of universities have recently changed their name and the system hasn't updated it). It's a 100% reduction. Ireland is the only country I've come across, which doesn't offer a student discount for international visitors.


**4. Loud Passengers**
Public transport in Ireland is unique in comparison to the rest of Europe, in that loud noise is generally accepted. One of the biggest changes for me living in another country coming from Ireland is how quiet public transport (in particular trains) was.


**5. Never on Time**
Public transport in Ireland is never on time, I have literally never taken a bus or train that arrived and departed on the time it was meant to. Generally, it's 20 minutes on either side of the expected time. Drivers don't give a shite, I was once on a bus which was an hour late and the driver got off to get a takeaway halfway through the journey.",-0.004373433583959894,0

In response to some of the above comments, my purpose here was to get past a simplistic “Don’t even bother looking at public transport in Ireland” narrative which is wrong” to a nuanced and informative discussion of where it might be a useful option to consider.

On the carbon issue, the carbon impact of seven million plus visitors arriving is fixed (no other way for say North American visitors to get here for example) but the impact while here is at least partially an impact of the transit choices they make while they are here. 

I still maintain that trains are good value- in my experience the cost for a couple of a journey between cities is usually comparable or less than driving your own car when you factor fuel, wear and tear and tolls and significantly less than hiring a car but as you say, it only gets you so far and starts to fall down badly when exploring many of our most popular sights like the Ring of Kerry, Connemara and the Cliffs of Moher. 

I just wanted to put out there (acknowledging the very valid points you make about those with more limited mobility) that you can cover a lot and have a very enjoyable experience using trains to move between cities and then selecting some well chosen day tours by tourism oriented operators or by hiring a car locally to access the harder to reach spots.",0.09039298515104965,1

Even reaching some B&Bs would not be possible without a car. The railway network is extremely limited in Ireland (in fact we had a larger network a century ago), so bus is the only option. Driving the small rural roads dotted with sheep is an experience in itself, and the cost of renting is also not so bad if sharing between 3-4 people and outside of summer months, in fact it can end up being cheaper than a train.",-0.07476190476190475,0

135,"You’re obviously entitled to your opinion here but some fact checking on your points:

Cost- It would seem your experience of fares is somewhat out of date.

 A ticket on the SNCF website from Montpellier to Toulouse (slightly shorter distance to Dublin to Westport ) costs €15 to €38 depending on time of day. Dublin to Westport has been priced at €16 for some
time and is available on all trains if booked in advance.

Students- overseas full time students are entitled to apply for a student leap card just as Irish students are which gives significant discounts (50%) and it only costs €5 so it would most likely pay for itself in first journey.
A little overhead in collecting it, admittedly (you have to show eligibility documentation to  a Leap card agent) but there was a perception that student cards were being abused previously (I know some night students who applied for and use them for example) so they have obviously tightened up on their issue.


 https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch#eligible. 

I have family members who just started studying in a number of the universities who recently changed name (SETU, ATU, TUS) and they all had their student leap cards up and running a few weeks into term. 

Punctuality- you may have been extraordinarily unlucky but average punctuality on the Irish rail intercity network (defined as arriving within 10 mins of schedule) is currently averaging about 92% with reliability close to 100%.

Also, for tourists, public transport isn't that important unless you're just going to stay in Dublin. Most people will just rent a car as we have a disjointed public transport network.

Also, Irish Rail doesn't offer a flat rate of €16, looking at the trains right now, the closest one is €18 which is still ridiculously expensive compared to the rest of Europe.

Regarding the Student Leap Card, to apply online, you have to enter a university that is on its system. Unfortunately, this is impossible for non-Irish residents as it doesn't recognise universities outside of Ireland. It doesn't even recognise my university, which is Irish, and has changed its name recently. Plus you have to collect the card from an agent which is only available in big cities, which makes it impossible for international visitors.

So an option might be to get train (slightly less convenient than the Galway train) to Ennis and buck the trend by getting the bus North, and on your return head south to Ennis unfortunately you’ll miss the Burren which is on the bus journey north from Doolin to Galway and very memorable scenery in my view.  Another possible option would be Dublin Galway (train) Doolin/Cliffs by bus, bus to Ennis and train back to Dublin from Ennis which at least avoids the risk that say the bus to Galway in Doolin has already filled up at the Cliffs.

Nearly as fast as driving when there was any amount of traffic, since I could just fly right past it. Completely changed my perspective on getting around.

I'm not trying to downplay the need for public transit in Ireland. We definitely need a lot more and it should be a lot better. My town used to have a railway line going to the city (built over 150 years ago and easily faster than a car journey today!) and they tore it up and now all we have is the shitty bus.

We see things very differently. The way I see it, it's not the fault of people driving. It's the fault of successive myopic government's trying to cash themselves in, and viewing transport as bing about profit. 


The issue with the way we currently do thing is ... Less cars on the road equals more cars, they just incentivise people to buy newer and literally solve nothing 


Cars take up a large proportion of our incomes through taxation and insurances, higher than most countries in Europe. Does it work? Nope, nope and double nope. Nothing is done to address the need  of transport


Change is more than slow. The north Dublin Luas line that was supposed to be completed 20 years ago... Won't be funded until 2035. Let that sink in. And how far behind the rest of the country is behind Dublin thanks to those pencil pushing civil servants who decide to incentivise themselves by...

Making everything more expensive than it needs to be for everyone else, for no good reason and without ever addressing the problem of the infrastructure being unsuitable! If you want other forms of transport to be more appealing, make them more appealing. We need less of an emphasis on taxing the individual motorists they're hit too hard already.

396,"The reality is that people will only start to move towards giving up their cars for transport when public transport or active transport (cycling & walking) is more appealing than car based transport in convenience, travel time, comfort and cost than the car. Improvement in any one of these factors will siphon away some people from their cars. All people do not have to give up their cars, it will be an incremental process. A New cycle lane that makes it more comfortable and safe to cycle to work instead of being in traffic, then some people will go from their car to a bike, reducing traffic. Bus connect scheme with high frequency reliable buses that get to your location quicker than a car stuck in traffic because it has a separated lane, more people will choose the bus, reducing traffic. This is a phenomenon called the [Downs-Thompson paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downs%E2%80%93Thomson_paradox) and is a well established transport planning phenomenon whereby the time it takes to get from A to B by car is correlated to the time it takes to get from A to B by either public or active transport. Hopefully the causation logic is obvious to people from my examples. The [best places](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8RRE2rDw4k) for traffic are those cities with the best active and public transport infrastructure.

Now how does Ireland get there as a country with poor public and active transport infrastructure? Just do it the way countries with good public and active transport got there. They incrementally investing in infrastructure through the years making policies that disincentivized car use and improved public and active transport. This investment, building and policies came at the expense of space for cars. Road side parking changed to bus lanes and cycle lanes. Streets in the city centre taking away access to cars entirely making really beautiful to be in pedestrianised districts. (As an aside The areas around Wicklow st, St.Andrews st, and Williams street in Dublin should all be pedestrianized and would make a beautiful pedestrianized quarter. The reason why they aren't is because there are a number of big multistory car parks that need to drive through there!) Cities that have done away with large car parks in the city center, which only encourages people to drive into the city so increasing traffic, are so much more pleasant. Cars are activity discouraged in urban areas in such cities as Copenhagen and Utrecht and it is made more and more inconvenient for people to drive their cars into the city centre. They basically ween them off this most inefficient mode of transport for urban areas.  

This is what needs to be done. It cannot be done overnight obviously and so it has to be an incremental process. We will not be banning all cars, we need to be divesting investment from car centric infrastructure and policy to more efficient and environmentally friendly kinds of transport. What this looks like is clearly [very unpopular](https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2022/08/03/dublin-north-strand-road-closed-inbound-to-cars-clontarf-cyclepath/?fbclid=IwAR3LMB7rllcopeE14QxZF5lGsZszXYe_0OrdH5ryLT3AFZZa0TvcZIFPQPY) as is seen from the reaction to the building of cycle lanes at the expense of cars and the taking away car parking spaces.

425,"It isn't a ""win for everyone in the end"". Grow up. People desperately need cars. They may have kids and elderly or sick relatives who can't get around on their own. So they're badly needed and always will be. The only solution to that is to massively decrease the distances between homes and service points, hospitals and schools. How are we gonna do that when we can't even build a port tunnel properly or extend the LUAS out to the airport without a ridiculous delay ? Let's get real here. 

Whilst it's true that there are far too many people using cars for solo journeys that are cycle-able or walk-able distances, these folks may be shopping instead and since a lot of shopping centres and malls have been flung out to the back-arse of nowhere near the major roads, they therefore, need to take the car - there's no two ways about it.

Public transport is still pathetically bad in this country - you simply can't rely on it. Even the DART in Dublin - which is running a long time now and still only has TWO tracks (London had an underground system in the 1930's) and trains are frequently late, delayed or simply cancelled without warning. 

So what's the answer here - destroy suburbia completely and have mile-high, super-dense city living where everything's 5 minutes away ? How about reigning in those people that live in the countryside and have to take the car to the nearest hospital, bank or post office (which have all subsequently been moved an extra 20-30 miles away in the nearest big town) ?

There's more financial barriers to car ownership here than most western European countries including taxation, an out of control insurance industry, VRT etc.

It's kind of funny how people ignore that a lot of the European countries people hold up as cycle friendly also treat motorists better than here and also build better motoring infrastructure, such as subteranean urban bypasses, and off-street parking with charging. I work with a lot of Europeans who have moved here, would like to see the country at their leisure and are frustrated at how expensive it is to get into a basic s\*\*tbox here, and we wonder why there's a talent shortage. Like many other things here, it's a rip, except there's a faux moral high ground used to perpetuate it.

Scandinavian countries for example understand that if you want to create cycle friendly cities, you can't take the Dublin approach of ""lets try squeeze some cycle lanes into narrow 17th century streets"" ..sometimes you;ve got to do some major surgery to the city itself, some buildings may have to go. We want omelettes, but we won't break eggs...

r/fuckcars is pretty US centric and honestly, while there's some retarded urban planning here, you need to go there to see truly ""unwalkable"" development, so a bit of perspective perhaps. You've not seen unwalkable until you find it pretty hard to get from your hotel on a business trip to the supermarket down the road without potentially being run over by six lanes of Ford F-150s and Chevy Tahoes. I always giggle a little when people whinge about ""huge SUVs"" here and really it's a Nissan Quashqai, which is a silly car, but you have no idea what a real SUV is. A Quashqai is a hatchback with notions... I am no defender of big cars (I mean a 50s cadillac is wonderful, but also very silly), I love Japanese Kei cars, yet ironically EU legislation is killing off the smallest cars - stuff Europe used to be good at making.

The logic here is backwards - making already miserable and high barrier of entry motoring even worse won't make public transport better, because that's what we've been doing since the founding of the state really, and it's achieved... well, where we are now. You build the infrastructure, you reduce the need for routine drudge commute journeys (like why are we going back to offices?), then the the rest follows.

Take Rathcoole as an example, I can drive to work in 30 mins, public transport is either a bus from the village (one per hour) or make my way to the luas (realistically need to drive to a park and ride) each of which involves another bus/luas from town or a 20/30 min walk to the office. The suggested cycle route is to take the N7…. so that’s wildly not a viable option and to take a safer route is probably around 90 mins minimum.

Until we get a handle on how we plan towns/villages and get public transport in place first you’ll never get a big reduction in car use in cities never mind in rural areas.

That said, I am environmentally conscious, I rather not use the car, however it’s not an option. Instead, I bought an electric car and about 20-30% of the power to charge the battery comes from the solar panels on the house. I also signed up to a green energy plan with Bord Gais. It’s not perfect because ev production still generates emissions, but even if I could solve the work commute issue, it’s still not viable to have no car, everything I need to do, from the big shop to cinema trips, to visiting family all needs a car 95% of the time.

We should focus on building up a proper public transport infrastructure, have proper planning and development that places public transport at the heart and make apartment living in the city more of a viable long term accommodation option. All these things will take time, so we also need to encourage ev usage. People who buy electric cars are also likely to consider solar panels and when considering solar panels will also look at things like air to water heating etc and increasing the BER rating of their houses.

The discussion about car use also revolves around car or no car, ignoring the fact that car share schemes exist and work well.

Public transport in Ireland is rubbish for sure. I'm not gonna defend it. 10-15 minute peak frequencies for the dart is embarrassing. Intercity rail that is slower than driving and often slower than the bus. Urban buses with unpredictable journey times and are constantly stuck in traffic.

I guarantee you the vast majority of people who claim, ""I would use my car less if the public transport was better"" either don't have rashers what PT is available to them, or has unreasonable expectations.

I live in the Dublin suburbs. There is a bus stop at the end of our estate, literally a 45 second walk away. There is a bus service which passes that stop every 10 minutes for most of day. It's a 24 hour service. It doesn't run every 10 minutes in the middle of the night, but the longest gap between busses  at 5:30 in the morning, is 40 minutes. 

Of course, your house is *right there*, so nobody has to stand outside at a freezing bus stop for 40 minutes.

Still, I know of at least two neighbours, who drive to work in the city centre. One has said that the bus is not reliable enough 🤷‍♂️, the other says that with having to pick up kids and such after work, the car is their only option. The latter sounds reasonable at first glance, but really what it means is, ""The car is more convenient"", not, ""I have no other options"". Because they absolutely could get the bus. Then walk, or get another bus or whatever, to get the kids, and go home.

And they're only the neighbours close to me. I have no doubt plenty of others also drive in or near the city centre.

The reality is a large majority of car journeys are trips of convenience, not necessity. People do it because they don't want to share a vehicle with others. They don't want to have to walk a couple of minutes at the start and end of their trips. They don't want to have to be subject to someone else's schedule. 

And that's just tough shit. None of these are reasonable excuses for taking the car. 

Yes, in a few cases there are no public transport options. But these are the exception. 

Over half of journeys under 2km are done in a car. That goes up to two-thirds for journeys under 4km.

Right now, that's being subsidised through different incentives that historic governments have given to motorists.
